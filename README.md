# MotivetomotionCPETERMPROJ
Motive to Motion is a project designed to provide a virtual escape whilst exercising. 

It uses the Oculus Rift (Unity) and M5Stack Core 2 (Arduino),
and provides users with three separate nature scenes to chose from:
Forest,
Beach,
Mountains.

It utilizes complete voice control through the windows.speech library, 
which has some issues in recognizing words and yet works efficiently and well 
for this purpose.

Commands include: 
"continue" to get past the welcome page
"forest", "beach", "mountains" to chose a scene
"options" to enter the option menu
"quit" to exit
"up" to speed up
"down" to slow down
"pause" and "back" to open and close the pause menu whilst playing
"dimmer" and "brighter" to adjust brightness
"quieter" and "louder" to adjust volume
